Shen Han was born in Hangzhou in 1988. He now lives and works in Berlin. 
Shen pursues the relationship between instincts and body movements in the process of marks making, connecting gestures to perceptions in the dominance of rather abstract images. His work usually does not have a planned subject matter, but initiates from the fluid consciousness in actions, creating an ambiguous tension onto the pictorial plane with basic painterly elements such as random shapes and broken lines. While working on his canvas, the pictorial assembly of laboring process will either diligently become loaded in favor of or against a visual comprehension through beholding, connecting the brain’s memory in the attempt of reading the seemingly half-way completed imageries, hence to depict and explore the human desires in a chaos of visual ecstasy.
